- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dev-Levy
- 👀 I’m interested in engineering, electronics and websites.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to be a Computer Science Engineer at the University of Óbuda.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything C# related or low-level coding. I've been enjoying C++ and ASSEMBLY recently
- 📫 How to reach me: just search for Oláh Levente on FB. I had a pfp with my French horn, so that's me.
